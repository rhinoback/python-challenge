# python-challenge
PyBank &amp; PyPoll
This Python challenge required working with election data from a CSV file and writing a "for/if" loop to get to our desired outputs using floats on vote counts and percentages. 
For the PyBank portion, the challenged called for a financial analysis based on total months, profits & losses, total revenue, averaage change, as well as greatest increase and decrease in a large CSV file of stocks. 
Used a counter, list, and "for" loop, to complete the challenge.
